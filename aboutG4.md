*Following Exerpt was taken from the [Sofie Biosciences Brochure](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ae75a6fa2772c3020f23b9a/t/5b0ddd9e6d2a737c30fb9878/1527635381880/SOFIE+G4+brochure+2017.pdf)

As small animal PET becomes an essential tool for translational research, SOFIE believes it
should be convenient and cost-effective, deliver high performance in a compact, easy-to-use
footprint, and keep your valuable animal models safe throughout the duration of the study.
Designed to function more like an imaging lab than a standalone scanner, G4 PET/X-ray is an
intuitive workflow solution

G4 PET/X-ray features the highest sensitivity PET scanner on the market at the lowest price. For 1/3 of the cost of traditional floor-based systems, G4 provides true benchtop multimodal imaging with integrated animal handling for mice and rats. When the bottom-line is as important as the quality of data.
