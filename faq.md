# Error Messages

## "Please select a targetable point. Use possible positions identify possible focal points"

This means that your selected quadrant (SR or SL or IL or IR) is not within the possible area that the software can target. You can see this area by toggling the "show possible positions" button in treatment planning. Align the ellipse so that the quadrant you have chosen as your target is within the white dot area. 

See this video where since we are targeting the SL (bottom left purple dot), we have to move the ellipse so that the SL (bottom left purple dot) falls into the white dot area (which represents the possible positions)

## "Please enter the X-RAY or PET directory path using "Input Current Directory" 

This means that the path in the "Input Current Directory" at the bottom of the Load New X-Ray tab is either invalid or blank. Ensure your path is correct by using the X-Ray database to locate your X-Ray file and then copying that into the "Input Current Directory Field". 

See this video for more details.
