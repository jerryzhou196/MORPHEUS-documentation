## Transducer Bases

Multiple bases were created to target different points in the coronal plane. The
transducer is placed on the cross of the base, and each one allows for different positioning.
Eighteen bases have been designed, this allows for the user to select 35 targets in a 24 mm2
area.

Figure 2.5 shows the transducer prototype, where the transducer is 10 mm in diameter
and has a focal point 8 mm away from the transducer surface. Each base has an arrow, and
can provide targeting for 2 positions depending on if the arrow is up or down. Figure 2.6
displays a sectional view of the transducer and base fitting into the main body.

To place the ultrasound focus at different locations within the two-dimensional head-foot (HF) vs right-left (RL) plane, multiple bases to support the transducer were developed. This image shows the Transducer base cross-reference list. With the moving system, it is possible to move 3mm in the HF direction and 2mm in the RL direction with spaces of 1mm.
